The code for this homework assignment can be found at \url{https://github.com/macattackftw/fractal_trees}.
The README explains how to use the scripts for each problem.

A considerable amount of implementation details, and the reasoning behind certain unsettling decisions, have been left out.
Of notable interest is how to install the prerequisite software, including Blender and the appropriate Python packages.
Feel free to contact the authors at \href{mailto:austin.gill@mines.sdsmt.edu}{austin.gill@mines.sdsmt.edu} and \href{mailto:kyle.w.macmillan@gmail.com}{kyle.w.macmillan@gmail.com} for more details.

Also note that there are a great many links to some of our results that are not possible to embed in a PDF document.
Particularly, interactive 3D renderings of many of the fractals are hosted \href{https://sketchfab.com/macattackftw/models}{online}.
