\section{Heatflow Simulation}

\subsection{Statement}
Implement a CA simulation of 2D heat flow.
Assume the domain is $0 < x < 10$, $0 < y < 10$, with insulated conditions on the top and bottom boundary.
Also assume that the right side is held at a constant zero degrees and the left side has a temperature profile of $y(10-y)$.
Use a $100 \times 100$ grid.
Insulation means zero flux. This implies that instead of fixed valued ghost points on the top and bottom, you modify the CA rules accordingly.

Generate several plots of the temperature profile at fixed values of time.
