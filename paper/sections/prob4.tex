\section{Heatflow Simulation}

\subsection{Statement}
Implement a CA simulation of 2D heat flow.
Assume the domain is $0 < x < 10$, $0 < y < 10$, with insulated boundary conditions on the top and bottom.
Also assume that the right side is held at a constant zero degrees and the left side has a constant temperature profile of $y(10 - y)$.
Use a $100 \times 100$ grid.

Generate several plots of the temperature profile at fixed values of time.
