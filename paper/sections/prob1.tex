\section{Generating a Simple Fractal Tree}

\subsection{Statement}

Generate a fractal tree by repeating a ``fork'' shape with default angle of $45^\circ$.
Scale each repetition of the whole fractal by $\frac{1}{3}$ each iteration.

Experiment with different angles.

\subsection{Method}\label{sec:l-system-method}

\subsubsection{Lindenmayer Systems}
Lindenmayer Systems are commonly referred to as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system}{L-Systems}. An L-System takes a
series of production rules and applies them to an
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom}{axiom}, or initial string for a
defined number of iterations. To define these L-Systems our approach utilizes a
JSON configuration file to store the system's variables:

\begin{minted}{json}
{
    "unit": 1,
    "angle": 0.392699082,
    "radius": null,
    "proportion": null,
    "axiom": "G",
    "iterations": 6,
    "randomness": null,
    "rules": {
        "G": "F+[[G]-G]-F[-FG]+G",
        "F": "FF"
    }
}
\end{minted}

A description for each of the JSON parameters is given in \autoref{tab:json_format}.
We implemented the following turtle commands\footnote{The book suggests other commands, but we though it best to use more intuitive symbols.}

\begin{description}
    \item[\mintinline{text}{F}, \mintinline{text}{G}] Make a unit step in the current direction
    \item[\mintinline{text}{f}, \mintinline{text}{g}] Make a unit step in the current direction without drawing
    \item[\mintinline{text}{-}, \mintinline{text}{+}] Yaw the turtle left and right, respectively, by the specified angle
    \item[\mintinline{text}{^}, \mintinline{text}{v}] Pitch the turtle up and down, respectively, by the specified angle
    \item[\mintinline{text}{<}, \mintinline{text}{>}] Roll the turtle CCW and CW, respectively, by the specified angle
    \item[\mintinline{text}{[}, \mintinline{text}{]}] Save and restore, respectively, the turtle's orientation on a stack
\end{description}

    \caption{JSON config file parameters}\label{tab:json_format}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}cl@{}}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{The Lindenmayer System for the Given Problem}
The problem required us to ``shrink'' the original to 1/3 size and apply it to
each angled protrusion. We accomplished that by coming up with an L-System
that grew each previous iteration by a factor of 3 each time it went through a
new iteration. The configuration for this system is given in \autoref{code:prob1_json}.

\begin{listing}[H]
    \begin{minted}{json}
        {
            "unit": 1,
            "angle": 0.785398163,
            "radius": null,
            "proportion": null,
            "axiom": "F",
            "iterations": 7,
            "randomness": null,
            "rules": {
                "F": "GGG[-F][F][+F]",
                "G": "GG"
            }
        }
    \end{minted}
    \caption{The JSON configuration for the given problem}\label{code:prob1_json}
\end{listing}

We were tasked with changing the angle to $90^\circ$ which resulted in a
Christmas tree-like structure. We were also tasked with changing the angle to
120° and it resulted in something similar to a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi\%C5\%84ski\_triangle}{Sierpiński triangle}.
All three versions have interactive 3D renderings viewable on
\href{https://sketchfab.com/macattackftw/collections/problem-1}{Sketchfab}.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Extending the Lindenmayer Systems to 3D}
The book mentioned symbols to expand the generation into different dimensions.
We borrowed some of those symbols to generate L-Systems that expanded in the
$x$, $y$, and $z$ dimensions. We applied this
concept to the $45^\circ$ version of problem 1 and it resulted in a very
\href{https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/prob1-3d-236e501897a945d0a3eb5e4cba37fa3a}{symmetrical tree (on SketchFab)}.
The JSON configuration for the given 3D rendering is shown in \autoref{code:prob1_3D_json}.

\begin{listing}[H]
    \begin{minted}{json}
        {
            "unit": 1,
            "angle": 0.785398163,
            "radius": null,
            "proportion": null,
            "axiom": "F",
            "iterations": 3,
            "randomness": null,
            "rules": {
                "F": "GGG[-F][F][+F][vF][^F][<F][>F]",
                "G": "GG"
            }
        }
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Problem 1 3D JSON}\label{code:prob1_3D_json}
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{Further Extensions of the Lindenmayer Systems}
Another concept the book mentioned was moving forward without drawing a line.
This was accomplished with the symbols \mintinline{text}{f} and \mintinline{text}{g}.
Utilizing this concept we were able to reproduce the
\href{https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/cantor-f645d6ae69a748a283a737f44660c5f6}{Cantor Set (on SketchFab)}.

We were making plant-like structures so we decided that anything over length 1
would be a ``branch'' and anything else was a ``leaf''.\footnote{In hindsight, this should have been some multiple of the forward step size instead of a constant 1.}
This led to much more
plant-like visualization of the L-Systems. A good example of this can be seen
in \autoref{fig:a_3d} and \autoref{fig:prob1_3d}. We did not have to stop
at 2 colors. We could have added any number of colors and based it on the
length or on the iteration. We chose 2 because it demonstrated the concept and
made the resulting system look better.

Future work could examine color gradients and slight color perturbation.
You could even incorporate new symbols to implement colormap manipulations.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/L-systems/a3d.png}
    \caption[3D L-system Example]{A 3D representation of the book Figure 7.24a}\label{fig:a_3d}
\end{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/L-systems/prob13d.jpg}
    \caption[3D Representation of Problem 1]{A 3D representation of problem 1}\label{fig:prob1_3d}
\end{figure}

We experimented further with radii proportionality and randomness but the
results didn't look as good. Radii proportionality did not look good as a
locked radii and would probably be better if done with a function instead of a
scaler. Randomness broke the fractal nature of the designs. We found that there
were many cases where patterns would loop back on themselves and generate
multiple identical cylinders. Applying the perturbation to angle or length
resulted in a complete breakdown of the fractal symmetry. It is possible that
some simple L-System variations may have looked better but we did not find one.

\subsection{Implementation}\label{sec:l-sys-implementation}
Implementation of this problem was done in three different Python submodules \mintinline{python}{lindenmayer.grammar},
\mintinline{python}{lindenmayer.graphics}, and \mintinline{python}{lindenmayer.turtle}.

\subsubsection{Grammar}
This submodule identified which symbols we would utilize as well as how it would
build the final string.
The function: \mintinline{python}{iapply} uses an infinite generator
to apply production rules to the \mintinline{text}{axiom} of the given iteration.

\begin{minted}{python}
    @staticmethod
    def _apply_symbol(args):
        symbol, rules = args
        return rules.get(symbol, symbol)

    def apply(self, text):
        """Apply the production rules to the given text."""
        return "".join(
            map(
                self._apply_symbol, zip(text, itertools.repeat(self.productions))
            )
        )

    def iapply(self, axiom):
        """Return an infinite iterator to apply the production rules to the given axiom."""
        while True:
            axiom = self.apply(axiom)
            yield axiom
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Graphics}
This submodule consumes the L-strings generated by the \mintinline{python}{lindenmayer.grammar} module.
We mapped each symbol to a different turtle function that would manipulate a ``turtle'' in 3D space.
For example the mappings for the symbols \mintinline{text}{F} and \mintinline{text}{^} are shown below.

\begin{minted}{python}
self.mappings = {
    "F": self.turtle.move,
    "^": self.turtle.pitch,
}
\end{minted}

We then iterate through the string (\mintinline{python}{commands}), applying the
appropriate mappings. We keep track of consecutive move commands to determine
segment length. This serves to reduce the number of cylinders we have to draw
and it allows us to assign a color scheme based on length.

Cylinders are saved as dictionaries with the following format:
\begin{minted}{python}
    cylinders.append(
        {
            "from": start,
            "to": end,
            "radius": self.radius,
            "material": "Branch" if length > 1 else "Leaf",
            "length": length,
        }
    )
\end{minted}

\autoref{table:dict_cylinders} defines what each attribute in a cylinder means.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Dictionary of Cylinders}\label{table:dict_cylinders}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Name}                   & \textbf{Description}               \\ \midrule
        \mintinline{python}{"from"}     & Origin                             \\
        \mintinline{python}{"to"}       & Destination                        \\
        \mintinline{python}{"radius"}   & Radius for segment                 \\
        \mintinline{python}{"material"} & Branch or Leaf dependent on length \\
        \mintinline{python}{"length"}   & Cylinder length                    \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our code for computing the cylinder vertices given the Lindenmayer graphics string (which we've chosen to call L-strings) is shown below.\footnote{
    We would normally not provide this much detail, but the discussion about optimizing the Blender
    scene creation later depends on understanding the nontrivial data structures it operates on.}

\begin{minted}{python}
    def compute(self, commands):
        """Generate the 3D cylinders from the given graphics commands.

        :param commands: A string of successive graphics commands.
        :returns: A dictionary of (length, [{cyl 1}, {cyl 2}, ...]) pairs.
        """
        cylinders = []
        commands = iter(commands)
        for command in commands:
            perturbation = (
                np.random.normal(scale=self.randomness) if self.randomness is not None else 0
            )

            length = 0
            start = self.turtle.position
            # Consume consecutive forward commands.
            while command in ("G", "F"):
                # Perturb only the angle. The drawing assumes many cylinders of the same length.
                self.mappings[command](self.unit)
                length += self.unit

                except StopIteration:

            end = self.turtle.position

            if length > 0:
                if self.proportion is not None:
                    self.radius = self.proportion * length

                cylinders.append(
                    {
                        "from": start,
                        "to": end,

                    }
                )
            if command in ("f", "g"):
                self.mappings[command](self.unit)

            if command in self.mappings and command not in ("G", "F", "f", "g"):
                if command in ("+", "^", ">"):
                    self.mappings[command](+self.angle + perturbation)
                elif command in ("-", "v", "<"):
                    self.mappings[command](-self.angle + perturbation)
                else:
                    self.mappings[command]()

        return [dict(t) for t in {tuple(d.items()) for d in cylinders}]
\end{minted}

Notice that subsequent \mintinline{text}{F} and \mintinline{text}{G} commands are consumed and only \textit{one} cylinder is produced.
This was necessary because Blender struggles to cope with large numbers of objects, even though it can easily handle large objects.

The particularly disgusting implementation is due to the fact that adding an object to the Blender scene forces an entire scene update.
Once you get past a few thousand objects (and note we're dealing with hundreds of thousands) adding an object to the scene begins to take quite some time --- the time it takes to add a single cylinder scales linearly with the number of existing cylinders, so the time it takes to add \textit{all} the cylinders scales exponentially.

We ended up implementing a multi-faceted approach to improving the scene creation time.
The particular facet that impacts the disgustingness of the code above is the ability of Blender to duplicated and manipulated \textit{copies} of existing cylinders in the scene.

In order to facilitate this copying, the \mintinline{python}{Graphics.compute()} function returns a \textit{dictionary} of
\[L \to \{\text{all cylinders with length $L$}\} \]
mappings for each cylinder length $L$ that is generated.

This way, the correspondingly disgusting code to add the cylinders to the Blender scene can create a master cylinder of each size, then produce transformed copies of each master cylinder for each corresponding cylinder.

We started to have L-strings that
were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of characters long. Speed became an issue with
sufficient iterations so we developed a batch system. We specify the number of
jobs we want to run via command line arguments\footnote{More explicit script documentation is available on the repository \href{https://github.com/macattackftw/fractal_trees}{README} page.}

\mintinline{shell}{./batch.sh data/b3d.json --jobs 32}

The above example chops up the generated \mintinline{text}{cylinders} list\footnote{Just to be clear,
    this is a dictionary of length to lists of cylinders mappings, where each cylinder in the list
    is itself a dictionary as described in \autoref{table:dict_cylinders}.}
into 32 pieces and runs a background Blender process producing a small portion of the overall fractal.

After each portion is created, the \mintinline{text}{batch.sh} script joins all of the fragments into a single master Blender scene.
Parallelizing the scene creation like this caused runtimes to go from from $\sim45$ minutes to a few seconds.

The batch process fires up \mintinline{text}{--jobs N} instances of Blender. This can
quickly consume all RAM.\footnote{
    RAM usage quickly became one of our limiting factors.
    We could have pushed this parallelism even farther, but simple loading the end scene in blender took, in extreme cases, took over 12 GB of RAM.
    Rendering such a scene was was found to be impossible, even with \textit{large} amounts of swap space (upwards of 32 GB).
}

Before parallelizing the scene creation, we were capped at fractals containing only 19,000 cylinders.
After parallelizing the scene creation, each individual job had this cap, and we were able to generate fractals using well over 500,000 cylinders.

If the resulting \mintinline{text}{.fbx} file was under 50MB we were able to upload it to
\href{https://sketchfab.com/macattackftw/models}{Sketchfab}.
Often, however, the resulting files were well over a gigabyte each.

\subsubsection{Turtle}
The \mintinline{python}{Turtle3D} class has a very simple interface:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \mintinline{python}{Turtle3D.push()}
    \item \mintinline{python}{Turtle3D.pop()}
    \item \mintinline{python}{Turtle3D.move(stepsize)}
    \item \mintinline{python}{Turtle3D.roll(angle)}
    \item \mintinline{python}{Turtle3D.pitch(angle)}
    \item \mintinline{python}{Turtle3D.yaw(angle)}
\end{itemize}

This class is an extension of the traditional planar Python standard library \mintinline{python}{turtle} module in three dimensions.

Transitioning to 3D space was incredibly simple due to Blender's \mintinline{python}{mathutils.Matrix}
class as seen in \autoref{code:roll_pitch_yaw}.
We spent a lot of time attempting to manipulate quaternions but found the \mintinline{python}{mathutils} module met
all of our requirements and didn't give us a headache.\footnote{
    Seriously. Quaternions are great and all, but we struggled for \textit{days} to get the
    transformations to be applied on each object's \textit{local} reference frame instead of on
    the global one.
}

\begin{listing}[H]
    \begin{minted}{python}
        def move(self, stepsize):
            """Move turtle in its heading direction."""
            vec = matmul(self.mat, Vector((stepsize, 0, 0, 0)))
            self.mat.col[3] += vec

        def yaw(self, angle):
            """Yaw the Turtle around its local Z axis."""
            self.mat = matmul(self.mat, Matrix.Rotation(angle, 4, "Z"))

        def pitch(self, angle):
            """Pitch the Turtle around its local Y axis."""
            self.mat = matmul(self.mat, Matrix.Rotation(angle, 4, "Y"))

        def roll(self, angle):
            """Roll the Turtle around its local X axis."""
            self.mat = matmul(self.mat, Matrix.Rotation(angle, 4, "X"))
    \end{minted}
    \caption{Roll, Pitch, Yaw code}\label{code:roll_pitch_yaw}
\end{listing}

Roll, pitch, and yaw are simply matrix multiplications applied to the existing
rotation. Move is a matrix multiplication applied to a unit vector pointing straight up, which is
then added to the turtle's current location.

\subsubsection{Existing Implementations}
There are a number of existing implementations for Lindenmayer Systems in Python --- at least one of which is even done in three dimensions.

The first implementation of L-Systems that we found was actually a \LaTeX{} Tikz implementation.
It's quite easy to use.
\autoref{fig:latex-lsystem} shows the result of the Tikz code shown in \autoref{code:latex-lsystem}.

                        step=2pt,
                        angle=25
                    }
            ] lindenmayer system;

        \end{document}
    \end{minted}
    \caption{A fractal plant with \LaTeX}\label{code:latex-lsystem}

We also found numerous 2D Python implementations. Some of which are listed below, ranked by their usefulness.

The original idea to make a variant of the Lindenmayer system in three dimensions came from \href{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42257676/l-systems-and-the-stack-in-maya}{this Stack Overflow post}.
However, in that post the author is using the Maya Python API, which has very little documentation and supporting material online.
Further, Maya is quite expensive (\$3,000+) for non-educational use, so there was little practical advantage to learning it on the side.
Thus we decided to use the free, open source modeling software \href{https://www.blender.org/}{Blender}.

Blender has excellent mathematics libraries for performing 3D graphics manipulation, which was exactly what we wanted for this project.
We spent roughly a week before another round of Googling produced the \href{https://github.com/lemurni/lpy-lsystems-blender-addon}{Lindenmaker Blender addon}.
Lindenmaker is a Python library that adds a new panel to Blender for producing L-system trees.
Lindenmaker is the result of the bachelor's thesis available \href{https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2017/LEOPOLD-2017-ALG/LEOPOLD-2017-ALG-thesis.pdf}{here}.

Due to the spirit of the assignment we decided to avoid blindly using the Lindenmaker addon without implementing our own solution.
However, we still took inspiration from Lindenmaker's implementation of the 3D turtle because we struggled getting quaternion transformations to apply to each object's \textit{local} reference frame.

\subsubsection{Computing the Vertices}

\subsubsection{Usage}
We initially designed this to be ran in a single thread with no concurrent
usage. This quickly proved inadequate for sufficiently large L-Systems.
The recommended usage of our project is to simply generate a JSON configuration file using
the format specified in \autoref{code:prob1_json} and \autoref{tab:json_format}.
Assuming the configuration file is saved as \mintinline{text}{myJSON.json}, you can create your
fractal scene by running the \mintinline{text}{batch.sh} script as shown below.

\mintinline{shell}{./batch.sh myJSON.json --jobs N}

The number of jobs used is limited only by the number of processors and RAM available.
Our initial experimentation showed that using more processes than processors was acceptable because
we needed to keep the number of cylinders in each fractal fragment under 20,000.
It is not recommended to go beyond 32 jobs unless you have more than 16GB of RAM due to how expensive
Blender is resource-wise.

It is possible to use the finer-grained Python scripts to leverage more control on how the jobs are
performed in parallel, but we found that we were too constrained by our available system resources for
this finer level of control to be useful.

The final resulting Blender file will be saved as \mintinline{text}{myJSON.blend}.
All of the resulting \mintinline{text}{myJSON-job-*-.blend} are intermediate results from the scheduled
jobs, and are the individual components that are joined together to form the final \mintinline{text}{myJSON.blend} file.

\subsection{Results}
Results of Problem one can be seen in \autoref{fig:prob1_45},
\autoref{fig:prob1_90}, and \autoref{fig:prob1_120}. The interactive \mintinline{text}{.fbx} files can be
found on \href{https://sketchfab.com/macattackftw/collections/problem-1}{Sketchfab}.

\subsection{Conclusion}
L-Systems are great for the generation of interesting fractal patterns.
We generated several additional variations which can be found on SketchFab
\href{https://sketchfab.com/macattackftw/models}{here}.

We wanted a visually appealing implementation and we accomplished that.
The L-System itself is rather straightforward.
Storing cylinder start/stop locations was relatively simple, and the bulk of our
work was spent on visualizing and optimizing the generated fractals to work with Blender.
While that was not the goal of the problem it was useful to
experiment with an unfamiliar API and integrate our product with it.

There could be future work in expanding color schemes, variable radii, random perturbations,
and further optimizing blender usage (such as chopping up the JSON file based on
batches). We thoroughly explored L-Systems and it was a fun project.
