\section{Reproducing the Book's Fractal Plants}

\subsection{Statement}
Use bracketed OL-systems to reproduce each of the plant-like fractals in Figure 7.24 of the book.

Experiment with the production rules and produce at least ten derivatives.\todo{We can put our 3D fractals under this category.}

\subsection{Method}
\todoinline{Just refer back to problem 1}

\subsection{Implementation}

\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Expanding the Lindenmayer Systems to 3D}
\todoinline[caption=3d results]{
    Discuss how to create more interesting 3D fractals, including Koch curves, the dragon curve, and 3D trees/bushes.

    Show the results from \texttt{data/a.json} with the book's parameters.
