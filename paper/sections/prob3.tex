\section{Generating a Fractal Landscape}

\subsection{Statement}
Implement the random midpoint displacement algorithm\todo{This is from section 7.6 in the book.}{} in 3D and generate some fractal landscapes.
Examine the influence of $H$ on the generated landscapes.

\todoinline[caption=Maybe do this in Blender too]{
    Maybe do this in Blender too, because we can create objects from meshes, which is what the heightmap would give us.

    The only trick would be to figure out how to color \textit{one} mesh with a height-based gradient.
